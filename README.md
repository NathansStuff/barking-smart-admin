# Policies and Procedures
To create new programs:

1. Determine what sort of programs you want to create
   1. How many of each type of tags, etc.





I am creating a dog activity website where users enter their dogs informtaion and can purchase programs with educatinal enrichment activities for their dog.

To create a database of activities, I need, on ach program / activity:
- title
- short description
- tags (indoors/outdoors, energy level 1-10, time quick/mid/long, challenge easy/md/hard, activity type (scent, agility, puizzle, etc)
- link to pdf
- activity content

When user wants a activity, based on dog info, I can generate logicthat says I need x of various tags - one set of logic for each tag, eg 10x activity scent, 20x activity agility and 10x quick 20xlong time for a total of 30 activities.
