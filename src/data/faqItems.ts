    question: 'What is Barkin Smart?',
    answer:
      "Barkin Smart creates custom enrichment plans tailored to your dog's unique personality, breed, age, and lifestyle. We help you keep your pup happy, healthy, and mentally stimulated — without the guesswork.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How does it work?',
    answer:
      "You fill out a quick form about your dog, and we'll deliver a personalised plan straight to your inbox. It's packed with enrichment activities, training ideas, and play suggestions, all matched to your pup's needs.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What age is this suitable for?',
    answer:
      "We've got you covered from puppyhood to senior years! Our plans adapt based on your dog's life stage, energy levels, and preferences.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to buy anything?',
    answer:
      "Not necessarily. Many activities use things you already have at home — towels, plastic bottles, cardboard boxes, etc. But we'll also give you a shopping list if you want to level up with things like puzzle toys or lick mats.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use this with more than one dog?',
    answer:
      'Yes! Just fill out a form for each dog to get individualised plans. Every dog is different, and we want to make sure each one gets what they need.',
  },
  {
    question: 'I have a full schedule, will this still work for me?',
    answer:
      'Not at all. We design the plan to fit around your schedule. Some activities take just 5–10 minutes a day, and you can swap or skip depending on your week.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I get a sample before I commit?',
    answer: 'Yes! We offer a free puppy enrichment week so you can try it out and see how your dog responds.',
  },
